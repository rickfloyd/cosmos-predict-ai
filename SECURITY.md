# ðŸ”’ Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Cosmos Predict AI platform to prevent vulnerabilities from AI-generated code and ensure enterprise-grade security.

## Security Architecture

### Core Security Components

1. **SecurityValidator Class**
   - Input sanitization and validation
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection detection
   - Content moderation

2. **RateLimiter Class**
   - API rate limiting
   - Abuse prevention
   - DDoS protection

3. **SecurityMonitor Class**
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Security event logging
   - Anomaly detection

### Quantum-Resistant Security

- **Cryptographic Agility**: Support for multiple encryption algorithms
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Ready for quantum computing threats
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation and secure storage

## Security Features

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection
- File upload validation
- Content moderation

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication
- Secure session management
- Age verification
- Fraud detection

### Monitoring & Logging

- Security event tracking
- Threat intelligence
- Real-time alerts
- Audit trails

### CI/CD Security Integration

- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) with SonarQube
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) with OWASP ZAP
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- AI-powered security analysis with Semgrep, Bandit, Safety

## Security Policies

### Password Policy

- Minimum 12 characters
- Complex requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- No common passwords
- Regular rotation

### API Security

- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- Request validation
- Authentication required
- Secure headers

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure key management
- Data minimization
- Privacy by design

## Threat Mitigation

### AI Code Vulnerabilities

- Automated code review

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- GDPR compliant
- ISO 27001 compliant
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Security Controls

- Access control
- Audit logging
- Incident response
- Continuous monitoring

## Security Dashboard

The security dashboard provides real-time visibility into:

- Security events
- Threat detection
- System health
- Compliance status

Access the security dashboard from the app settings menu.

## Incident Response

### Response Process

1. Detection and analysis
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery
5. Lessons learned
